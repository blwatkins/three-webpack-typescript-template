## Getting Started

Create a new project from this template using the green "Use this template" button above.

Write the project's source code in the `src/` directory.
The `src/main.ts` file provided contains a simple Three.js program with a rotating green cube.
This file will be used as the entry point for webpack.

### Installation

```shell
npm install
```

`npm install` will install all the dependencies required to run this project.

### Linting

#### Linting TypeScript

```shell
npm run lint:ts
```

`npm run lint:ts` will lint the TypeScript source code using ESLint, identifying syntactic and stylistic errors based on a configured set of rules.
TypeScript linting configurations and rules can be found, edited, and updated in `eslint.config.ts.mjs`.

#### Linting JavaScript

```shell
npm run lint:js
```

`npm run lint:js` will lint the JavaScript configuration files using ESLint, identifying syntactic and stylistic errors based on a configured set of rules.
JavaScript linting configurations and rules can be found, edited, and updated in `eslint.config.js.mjs`.

### Building the Bundle

#### Building the Bundle in Development Mode

```shell
npm run build:dev
```

`npm run build:dev` will bundle your sketch in development mode using webpack.
This should identify any compiler errors present in your source code.
The webpack build configuration can be found in `webpack.config.mjs`.

#### Building the Bundle in Production Mode

```shell
npm run build
```

`npm run build` will bundle your sketch in production mode using webpack.
The webpack build configuration can be found in `webpack.config.mjs`.

### Serving the Bundle

#### Serving the Development Bundle

```shell
npm run serve:dev
```

`npm run serve:dev` will bundle the scene in development mode, start a localhost development server (`127.0.0.1:8080`), and open a new browser window for the `index.html` file bundled with the compiled scene.

#### Serving the Production Bundle

```shell
npm run serve
```

`npm run serve` will bundle the scene in production mode, start a localhost development server (`127.0.0.1:8080`), and open a new browser window for the `index.html` file bundled with the compiled scene.

## GitHub Workflows
